So here are my thoughts:\n\nAs I understand, there are two types of flows with different characteristics:\n\n1. flows rate-limited using CC\n2. flows for which short bursts are allowed, with the assumption that the long-term bitrate is below the policy\n\nBecause SCONE signals are purely advisory that endpoints often cannot adhere to (see #29), network elements have to monitor the long-term bitrate of type 2 connections, and if they are exceeding the limit, demote them to type 1. This would be the ordinary business for any SCONE-compatible network elements with the capability to enforce bitrates.\n\nIf network elements want to demote flows without paying the cost of monitoring the long-term bitrate, they can consult the QUIC Version field of the first few packets sent by the server. As stated, there will be false positives; hence this is an optimization.\n\nThe question regarding client-driven indication is, IMO, if we want to have another knob for optimization, providing the capability to demote flows just by looking at the first packet from the client. Note we would have even more false positives than the first knob, because clients might be sending Indications to servers that do not support SCONE.\n\nWhile I\u2019m not necessarily opposed to having Indications, I am still wondering why some think it is insufficient to only have the first optimization knob (i.e., see if the server sends SCONE packets early).\n\nThe heavyweight task that the network elements cannot avoid is actually measuring the long-term flow rate and demoting the connections. Compared to that the benefit for having the 2nd knob (Indications) seems marginal if any, even though it makes things much more complex.",

          "body": "Hi @kazuho \n\nThanks for your thoughts on this. Following up on the discussion, here's my perspective:\n\nFrom a network element standpoint that uses deep packet inspection (DPI) for rate limiting, the process involves identifying potential video sessions and then applying rate limits based on the subscriber's data plan (e.g., 2 Mbps, 4 Mbps). This results in traffic being passed to the radio network at the specified bit rate, and any excess traffic arriving at a faster rate is discarded.\n\nConsidering this within the SCONE working group, it seems beneficial if a client application on the user equipment (UE) initiating adaptive bitrate (ABR) video playback could signal to the rate-limiting network element: \"I can send packets at a rate you can handle, so you don't need to drop them.\" This uplink indication would provide the network element with information to consider.\n\nUpon receiving such a signal, the network element might forgo DPI and potentially wait for a corresponding signal on the downlink for the same 4-tuple (within a reasonable timeout period) before applying the allowable rate limit. While inspecting downlink traffic can be resource-intensive, minimizing this inspection could be a desirable optimization.\n\nConversely, without this client-side notification, a network element relying on DPI will likely start enforcing rate limits immediately at the beginning of a video session, as it has no initial way of knowing if the client application is SCONE-capable.\n\nFor SCONE deployment, this early signaling mechanism distinguishes SCONE flows from non-SCONE flows. It's also important to note that SCONE usage is separate from the congestion control mechanisms within the mobile packet core and the RAN, and therefore outside the scope of our SCONE discussions.\n\nThanks,\nSanjay",

This results in traffic being passed to the radio network at the specified bit rate, and any excess traffic arriving at a faster rate is discarded.\n\nObviously, if your condition is that you do DPI, then you do DPI.  But if your goal is to ensure that video does not exceed a given limit, is DPI really necessary?\n\nMy understanding is that the main concern is high network consumption over long periods of time, something that video is uniquely \"good\" at.  Right now, you use DPI to ensure that you do not limit non-video flows.  But in a world where you have the potential for SCONE to be used on those flows that you are interested in, isn't there a different approach?\n\nAt the start of a flow, you do not limit it, but set a timer.  If that timer pops without seeing SCONE, you switch the rate limit on with a relatively small window.  However, if you see a SCONE signal before then, you switch the timer on with a looser timer.  The rate limit would be the same in both cases, but the SCONE flow would have a deeper token bucket, so would be able to perform better.  There's no DPI involved.  The cost being that video flows will potentially observe huge throughput for the path and might get overenthusiastic in their choice of quality, which can degrade the overall experience.\n\nNow, with an indication, you are in much the same situation.  A signal might cause the DPI to be skipped, but then you still have two eventual end states: one where the signal never manifests and one where you see a SCONE signal.  I can't imagine that the outcome is any different.\n\nI say that because when you say:\n\n> Upon receiving such a signal, the network element might forgo DPI and potentially wait for a corresponding signal on the downlink for the same 4-tuple (within a reasonable timeout period) before applying the allowable rate limit. \n\nThat implies that you are exposing yourself to flows opting out of DPI.  And you can't go back in time and do DPI for that flow if you do that.  So if the signal never arrives -- something that seems likely -- you have lost the opportunity to \"classify\" the flow according to your DPI-based logic.\n\nFor me, the only thing that is potentially relevant here is this transitionary period where only some clients and servers support SCONE.  There, having an indication might be useful, but I don't see the game theory of this working out.  I can't see a network that currently uses DPI for classification giving that up; so unless you want to promise that on behalf of your employer and find other network operators willing to make similar commitments, this all seems pretty speculative to me.",

But what I can say is that, in several conversations with CSPs, the potential for reducing the load caused by DPI in the user plane functions is one of the most attractive aspects of SCONE-like solutions. Initially, they would not disable DPI; rather, they would introduce SCONE into their DPI signatures. Packet filters matching \"_the SCONE application_\" would have higher priority than the more complex ones targeting individual applications based on SNI and similar. \nThis approach allows a gradual shift to SCONE-like policies (longer enforcement windows) for traffic that adopts SCONE early, while retaining existing throttling policies (shorter enforcement windows) for other traffic.\n\nThis, of course, only matters if you're not using your DPI for other purposes as well. However, there aren't many use cases beyond this type of policy enforcement where DPI must run in real-time on all flows (unless you're in the business of censorship or similar). Often, DPI is used primarily for collecting statistics or business intelligence; in these scenarios, performing DPI on a statistically significant subset of flows is possibly sufficient.\n\n> At the start of a flow, you do not limit it, but set a timer.

The cost being that video flows will potentially observe huge throughput for the path and might get overenthusiastic in their choice of quality, which can degrade the overall experience.\n\nI would hope that we end up with something like this. \nMy worry is that the leap from the current situation to something like this approach, without an intermediate step, will be too significant for many CSPs, since it involves rethinking policy enforcement to some extent, which is more than a technical problem. The options would then be to either keep relying on DPI for classification, which reduces the incentive to deploy SCONE, or to apply some phased approach e.g., as described above, and gradually assess the benefits.\n\nAllowing for, _optional_, early SCONE indications is a way to help adoption of the technology, and is imo a small price to pay in terms of both protocol and specification complexity.\n",

There has to be something gained by the application, otherwise it will just not bother. Plausible gains:\n\n1) Allow application to implement some long term tuning to network capacity (by opposition to just follow short term congestion feedback). This should result in lower latency because the application could forgo \"capacity probing\" strategies that build queues, and possibly lower power consumption (don't bother firing up a hi-def codec if you know that will not work).\n\n2) Make the traffic more \"regular\" -- the natural consequence of application tuning. The shorter queues in the network improve its overall efficiency, which should be visible in measurement of latency and packet loss.\n\nNone of that actually requires \"policing per flow\" or special-casing flows that use SCONE. Networks will still need to implement forms of active queue management at the edges, and should really work to implement ECN for real time feedback. It is just that flows that actually keep within the envelope advertised by SCONE will experience many fewer congestion events, ECN/CE marks, or AQM induced latency.\n",

There is quite a simple win-win that would happen _today_ in many networks if we had SCONE. These are networks where:\n\n1. DPI is utilized per-flow to identify our application as video (even when it's not) and aggressively police it for a variety of reasons and in a variety of situations.\n2.

Deploying ECH is not viable since ultimately \"networks are going to do what networks are going to do\" and the obvious thing to do is to be even more heavy handed since the \"arms race\" is extremely slow for them.\n\nIf we could wave a magic wand and have SCONE + the indication, there are networks where they _would absolutely_:\n1. Utilize SCONE to signal their advice.\n2. Disable 100% DPI for those flows since it has a significant cost for flow setup.\n3. Disable policing as long as the aggregate behavior of an application matches the signaled advice.\n4. Free us to deploy ECH on these flows.\n\n3 In particular would also give them a competitive edge over their peers who still rely on the policing, giving an urgency for other CSPs to adopt the same practices.\n\nWe could achieve this by having SCONE + an indication and setting it on all flows. I don't know what else to say to assure you this isn't hypothetical. It's a win for applications and for the operators. Frankly the one I am least convinced by having a big \"win\" in this situation is a vendor but at the end of the day if their customers are asking for it, they will provide it.",

Today, any flow marked as \u201cvideo\u201d typically receives a far lower throughput allowance than generic traffic\u2014even when it\u2019s bursty. If providers treat client-driven SCONE Indications as just another way to label traffic \u201cvideo,\u201d endpoints will effectively be barred from sending any non\u2011video data over SCONE.\n\nAs we discuss in #29, that outcome would sabotage browser adoption\u2014browsers can\u2019t predict in advance how a connection will be used, so they can\u2019t safely opt in to SCONE if it means risking severe throttling. In the end, the only services that could realistically benefit from deploying SCONE would be those already classified as video. For everyone else, the incentive could turn out to be to avoid SCONE entirely, since advertising it would trigger the very low\u2011throughput \u201cvideo\u201d treatment.\n\nOf course, CSPs remain free to throttle as they see fit\u2014but there\u2019s a world of difference between \u201cthey can throttle\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re giving them a mechanism to reclassify potentially non\u2011video traffic as video just to throttle it.\u201d\n\nHow do we prevent that second scenario?

To be clear, I am not at all sure this is a good idea, but at least there's no DPI and it aligns with my general principle of \"If I wanted the network to know something, I'd tell it explicitly.\"\n\nI'd also be fine having a packet type that says \"Put the reverse path bandwidth in this\" that we can send in the first flight if we're doing 0-RTT and with the ClientFinished if we're not.  That would prevent it ever being sent in cases it hadn't been negotiated.\n\nFor throttling, I think the implementation is fairly easy: Keep doing what you're doing until you see a SCONE packet.  My understanding is that most networks have some initial token-bucket model to ensure web pages load quickly, so they might let the first 100 packets through unthrottled even today.\n\nAs a person who writes congestion controllers and runs QUIC on servers, having the receiver and not the sender receive this signal is potentially problematic. It's fine for apps, but are we going to expose this value to browser clients so they can do ABR or communicate it to the server so it can do ABR?\n\nPaths are commonly not symmetric, so I can appreciate the benefits of sending the SCONE packet in the relevant data path, but I do really want to have this information sender-side.",

In fact, without ECH the _exact same information_ is available at the same time (the client's ability to receive SCONE packets), by parsing the CH and looking for the SCONE transport parameter. It's just relatively costly to do so but since the existing practice requires decrypting the Initial packet anyway, it's perfectly viable to do.\n\nAn endpoint cannot control what the network does or does not decide based on SCONE or an indication or (as is common today) the contents of SNI or IP addresses.

Elements that inspect the first packet from the client and enforce different bitrates using congestion control (CC).\n* B. Elements that can observe the throughput of a small number of SCONE flows and apply CC based on long-term flow rates.\n* C. Elements that can observe the throughput of all SCONE flows and apply CC based on long-term flow rates.\n\nFor type A elements, Indications could become a new tool to identify the type of flow and apply CC accordingly. This behavior wouldn\u2019t negatively affect flows already throttled by SNI inspection. However, it would hinder SCONE adoption among applications that currently aren't throttled\u2014being (mis)classified as video flows would lead to lower throughput.\n\nFor type B elements, Indications might be beneficial during SCONE\u2019s early adoption phase. These elements can distinguish between potentially SCONE flows and definitely non-SCONE flows just by inspecting the first client packet. They could treat the small number of SCONE flows differently while continuing to apply DPI + CC-based throttling to the non-SCONE majority.\n\nBut as SCONE adoption grows and the number of SCONE flows approaches or exceeds the capacity of these network elements, what happens then? As far as I can tell, their only practical option is to revert to applying CC-based throttling to SCONE flows. That\u2019s the only viable path forward.\n\nFor such elements, it's possible they would behave similarly even without Indications. While inspecting the first packet is easier, they can still analyze later packets if needed.\n\nHowever, the key point is this: network elements that behave in this manner\u2014like type A\u2014would deter SCONE adoption at the endpoint, or cause users to disable SCONE, because using SCONE would result in degraded performance.\n\nFor type C elements, Indications are unnecessary. These elements can assume all flows are SCONE by default and only apply CC-based throttling if no SCONE packets are observed for a certain duration, or if long-term throughput exceeds a threshold.\n\nIn summary:\n* Indications are likely to be misused by type A elements, leading to reduced SCONE adoption.\n* Indications might help type B elements early on, but as SCONE scales, such elements may become harmful.\n* Indications are meaningless for type C elements.\n\nPeople may have different visions for SCONE, but in my view, the best-case scenario is:\n* most, if not all, internet traffic becomes SCONE;\n* network elements can recommend appropriate video bitrates to *any* flow, rather than relying on a static list of SNIs (win for network operators);\n* and bursts are allowed, enabling non-video data to transfer quickly\u2014regardless of whether the flow is application-specific or mixed (win for applications).\n\nFrom this perspective, misuse by type A elements is purely detrimental. Moreover, type A elements are the most commonly deployed today. If they begin applying CC-based limiting based on Indications, there would be little incentive for new applications to adopt SCONE. This, in turn, would remove any reason for future network elements to properly support SCONE, stalling its adoption altogether.\n\nType B elements are landmines best avoided, and we should refrain from providing incentives that would facilitate their development.",

They do this by applying what we are calling \"DPI\" but more concretely is being able to parse the entire packet.\n3. The classification as ABR video is often done by trying to find the SNI of known ABR video hostnames.\n4. If they classify as ABR video they apply what we're calling \"CC throttling\" or similar in this thread, by applying a token bucket queueing that either buffers or drops packets or some combination thereof.\n\nThe indication basically exists to make obviate the need for doing 2-4 while we work to make SCONE ubiquitous.

Specifically, video policing is designed for video-playing applications utilizing adaptive bitrate video, and it does not extend to non-video traffic. Responding with a throughput advice to every QUIC connection would be impractical due to a couple of key reasons: first, within the context of SCONE, its application would be limited solely to ABR video; second, it would introduce an unwelcome and unpredictable processing load on the network\n\n> Or this is really based on subscriber policy meaning different subscriber get different advice or does not get anything at all?\n\nDetermining the appropriate video policy for a session does involve assessing both the subscriber's data plan and the radio access technology being used (4G/5G). A Throughput advice for SCONE will need to consider the subscriber's plan and the network they are connected to. For example, subscribers with a premium 5G plan will experience less strict video policing compared to those on other plans within the 5G network and on a 4G network.",

If the \"scone capable\" indication is applied only to ABR-video QUIC connections, the SCONE protocol would not only eliminate the need for SNI in flow detection but also provide a stronger rationale for its deployment.\n\nHowever, applying the \"scone capable\" indication to all QUIC connections would mean our network would need to inspect every QUIC connection, regardless of whether it's a video flow. We would still need to rely on SNI to determine if a specific QUIC connection is a video flow to decide whether to populate the throughput parameter in the SCONE packet.\n\nIf my understanding is correct, it seems that implementing SCONE in this way would add to CPU processing, and the benefit compared to our current process is unclear to me. Additionally, SCONE's applicability is limited to QUIC, and TCP connections will still exist.\n\nCould you please clarify if my understanding is correct?",

Speculative text about using congestion control signals to trigger TRONE packets when congestion eases: Consider then a condition in which congestion eases, either because the\ncompeting connections end or because the wireless transmission capacity\nimproves. The endpoints will notice that the rate of ECN marking rate has\nbecome low enough, and that the path is not congested anymore. However,\nthey don't know by how much they can increase their sending rate. Most\ncongestion control algorithms will proceed cautiously, allowing the\napplication to increase its sending rate step by step and verifying at each\nstep that they are not causing congestion. In these cases, a TRONE\nsignal can inform them about the changed capacity of the path and allow\nthem to increase capacity faster.\n\n2. Speculative text about using the TRONE signal to inform congestion control at the beginning of a connection: The TRONE signal can be particularly useful at the very beginning of a\nconnection. Congestion control algorithms typically start with a\nslow start process in which the application is allowed to double\nits sending rate after each RTT, until congestion is notified. This\nresults in a burst of excess transmission during the last RTT,\ncreating queues and possibly causing packet losses. Queues and\nlosses will affect not just the new connection that is testing the\ncapacity of the path, but also all established connections that\nshare the bottleneck. If the endpoints are using TRONE and learned the\nmaximum capacity of the path, they can exit the slow start process\nas soon as the maximum capacity has been tested, and avoid creating\nqueues or causing packet losses.\n\n3. Speculative text linking TRONE and \"careful resume\": The TRONE signal can also be useful if the applications remembers the\ncongestion control parameters of previous connections, and uses a\n\"careful resume\" process to quickly ramp up capacity as specified\nin  ({{?I-D.ietf-tsvwg-careful-resume}}). The endpoints could use\nTRONE to verify that the path characteristics have not changed\nsince the last connection before applying the careful resume\nprocess.\n\n4. General advice that if congestion uses the TRONE signal, it should be aware that if could be spoofed: In all cases, the endpoints should consider that the TRONE signal could\nhave been spoofed (see {{security}}). The congestion controller can use\nthe maximum capacity indicated by TRONE as a guide, but it\ncan also cautiously probe for available\ncapacity beyond the limit until receiving congestion signals.\n\nWe may want to use some of this text to specify whether and how congestion control use the TRONE signal. This is not obvious, because the general advice is that the two are independent, but it would be naive to believe that nobody would try plugging the capacity signaled by TRONE in their congestion controller. It might be better to explain the pitfalls of doing that, and perhaps signal the rare points where it makes sense.\n\nWe may also want to look at how \"easing of congestion\" could be used as a trigger for sending SCONE packets. This is somewhat experimental, because current congestion algorithms only detect easing of congestion if the application can push more data. An application working under the TRONE specified rate limit would not be able to do that.

If we strictly kept that focus, we have a privacy issue. Third parties could observe the presence of Trone headers, and infer that the end to end QUIC connection is engaged in video streaming.\n\nTo reduce the privacy issue, we could adopt a combined strategy, and ask more applications to support Trone, thus weakening the correlation between Trone and video.\n\nWe could also envisage greasing, with applications sending datagrams composed of a Trone packet, followed by a short header and random content. If the peer is not Trone capable, such greasing packets will be discarded because they do done decrypt correctly. But the third parties cannot check the encryption, so they will not be able to distinguish such packets from \"real\" Trone -- i.e., successful greasing.",

Receivers will no longer be required to calculate the minimum.\n\nNetwork elements would still be required to observe two versions and rewrite them as necessary (possibly to a different version), but considering that we only have 6 spare bits in the QUIC invariants before variable length fields, I think we have to either squeeze all bit rates into 6 bits or live with having multiple versions indicating different bit rates.",

But meanwhile, we need to find a window that works for all users of SCONE.\n\nDifferent video applications choose to buffer different lengths of videos during playbacks. For example, App A may buffer 10s while App B buffers 20s. A 10-second window will work for app A but not work for app B. A 20-second window will work for both.\n\nA flow that complies with a short window will also comply with a longer one.\n\nThis means we should probably specify a longer window to accommodate different applications, but not too long that exceeds the average duration of a video connection.

I think the strategy can be different between the applications; some can send two packets, others can send one but use an ACK to see if the datagram that has the TRONE packet attached reached the peer.

Radio channel conditions are signaled constantly to the radio access network, but they are ephemeral and not shared to the core in real time. So 'rapidly changing urban environment' signal strength is not worth attempting to convey at this stage, but as mentioned above, there could be a way to determine when a signal strength (and hence throughput constraints) are likely to last for the session.

That limits the number of markings that are needed and does not reveal anything extra.  The challenge being in ensuring that the network element is aware that TRONE markings are available.  For that, I would recommend always sending one packet at least once, even when the active usage is well outside of the protocol-defined ranges.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, an application that MIGHT operate in just the TRONE2 range reveals information that the network does not otherwise obtain if it sends the TRONE2 signal.",

You are taking the word of one path element and extrapolating to the entire path.\r\n\r\nLet's say that you get a 1Mbps signal.  You are currently at ~30kbps.  It might be reasonable to skip a few steps in your capacity probing to get closer to 1Mbps.  But that might be based on an assumption about the relative availability of bandwidth in modern networks and maybe past experience with the same network; I doubt you would make the same guess at 1Tbps (if that were a possible signal, that is).\r\n\r\nI conclude that while the congestion controller might be nudged a little, senders still need to have one and use that to probe the actual path availability.  The network still has queues and other users.  Expressions of policy limitations don't necessary entail guarantees, even at the node that is making that assertion.",

For video playback using chunked files, the two signals would be handled differently; congestion control applies to the transport, while the TRONE signal would be used for choosing the chunks with the appropriate bitrate. Note each chunk can be sent much faster than the rate indicated by TRONE, as long as the average bitrate (including the idle period) remains below the TRONE value.",

The Indication as defined by this PR has only one form: appended at the end of the datagram, which is incompatible with short header packets of QUIC v1.\r\n\r\nBut separately, I think @martinthomson is raising an interesting question.\r\n\r\nNo matter how we design indications, they will not work when the client migrates involuntarily. Therefore, we will have to consider how we handle SCONE-compatible flows that do not send indications.\r\n\r\nConsidering that, I think it's worth discussing if network elements could handle all flows as potentially being SCONE-compatible, rather than relying on indications that might or might not work.",

(to more explicitly indicate active rate limiting).\r\n\r\nLine 164: Removed \"In that case, capacity is less likely to be split between multiple active flows.\" because capacity will always be divided between multiple active flows (otherwise they would not be active)\r\n\r\nLine 165: Added that a SCONE signal based on the network's calculation of throughput advice would take into account congestion, whereas (as stated in the original) one simply stating a rate limit would not.\r\n\r\n(Other suggested changes are editorial)",
