During the discussion, I heard the view that there is no need for that, because in practice there is only one bottleneck and one TRAIN rewriter. I am really not sure about that -- I can really imagine a cascade of NATs, each believing that they are the only one enforcing bandwidth. The rule that you propose implies that any \"rewriter\" must check a specific bit, and if it is set jump to the payload and analyze it. Which implies that all on path agents will need to support \"checking the payload\", in which case I am not sure I see the point of having the information in the top bits.",

I agree that there are possible cases, but they are probably not that common. A network element that only considers the top bits could simply not send throughput advice if it sees the \"check the payload\" bit. ",
