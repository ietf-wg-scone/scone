1.  Introduction

   Many networks have known, concrete rate limits, or apply these limits
   by policy to constrain data rates.  This is often done without any
   indication to applications.  The result can be that application
   performance is degraded, as the manner in which rate limits are
   enforced can be incompatible with the rate estimation or congestion
   control algorithms used at endpoints.

   Having the network indicate what its rate limiting policy is, in a
   way that is accessible to endpoints, allows applications to use this
   information when adapting their send rate.

   The Standard Communication with Network Elements (SCONE) protocol is
   negotiated by QUIC endpoints.  SCONE provides a means for networks to
   signal the maximum available sustained throughput, or throughput
   advice, associated with the flows of UDP datagrams that QUIC
   exchanges.

   Any network function that is able to update the content of UDP
   datagrams qualifies as a network element that can participate in
   SCONE and provide throughput advice to QUIC endpoints.

   Networks with rate limiting policies can use SCONE to send throughput
   advice to cooperating endpoints to limit overall network usage.
   Where congestion control signals -- such as ECN, delays and loss --
   operate on a time scale of a round trip time, throughput advice
   operates over a much longer period.

   This has benefits in some networks as endpoints can adapt network
   usage to better suit network conditions.  For example, radio networks
   and battery-powered devices perform better with short, bursty
   exchanges, rather than constant transmission at a fixed rate.

   For endpoints, SCONE throughput advice makes network policies
   visible, which can reduce wasteful probing beyond those limits.

2.  Overview

   QUIC endpoints can negotiate the use of SCONE by including a
   transport parameter (Section 6) in the QUIC handshake.  Endpoints
   then occasionally coalesce a SCONE packet with ordinary QUIC packets
   that they send.

   Network elements that have rate limiting policies can detect flows
   that include SCONE packets.  The network element can indicate a
   maximum sustained throughput by modifying the SCONE packet as it
   transits the network element.

   The propagation of SCONE packets, including the throughput advice
   that is added, is shown in Figure 1.

   |  QUIC  |    | Network |     |   QUIC   |
   | Sender |    | Element |     | Receiver |

       |              |               |

       |              |               |

                   Figure 1: Propagation of SCONE signal

   QUIC endpoints that receive modified SCONE packets observe the
   indicated version, process the QUIC packet, and then record the
   indicated rate.

   Throughput advice only applies to the direction and path for which it
   is received.  A connection that migrates or uses multipath [QUIC-MP]
   cannot assume that throughput advice from one path applies to new
   paths.  Advice for the client-to-server direction and the server-to-
   client direction of each path are independent, and are expected to be
   different, for reasons including asymmetric link capacity and path
   diversity.  Applications may choose to utilize SCONE in either or
   both direction(s) of each path as they see fit.

3.  Applicability

   This protocol only works for flows that use the SCONE packet
   (Section 5).

   The protocol requires that packets are modified as they transit a
   network element, which provides endpoints strong evidence that the
   network element has the power to apply a rate limiting policy; though
   see Section 9 for potential limitations on this.

   The throughput advice signal that this protocol carries is
   independent of congestion signals, limited to a single path and UDP
   packet flow, unidirectional, and strictly advisory.

3.1.  Independent of Congestion Signals

   Throughput advice signals are not a substitute for congestion
   feedback or congestion control.  Congestion signals, such as
   acknowledgments or ECN markings [ECN][WHY-ECN], provide information
   on loss and delay that indicate the real-time condition of a network
   path.  Congestion signals might indicate a throughput limit that is
   different from the signaled throughput advice.

   Endpoints cannot assume that the rate indicated in throughput advice
   is achievable if congestion signals indicate otherwise.  Congestion
   could be experienced at a different point on the network path than
   the network element that signals throughput advice.  Therefore,
   endpoints need to respect the send rate constraints that are set by a
   congestion controller.

   Networks can use SCONE to communicate throughput advice for reasons
   other than rate limiting policies.  For example, a network element in
   an access network could provide throughput advice to guide
   application use of network capacity, in any way that is separate from
   any signals that are intended to influence congestion response.

   In addition to rate limiting policies, throughput advice can indicate
   temporary increases in available capacity or temporarily reduced
   capacity.  This includes persistent overuse, equipment faults, or
   other transient issues.  Providing advice is applicable if increases
   or reductions are expected to last for more than one monitoring
   period; see Section 5.2.

3.2.  Unspecified Scope

   Modifying a packet does not prove that the throughput that is
   indicated would be achievable.  A signal that is sent for a specific
   flow is likely enforced at a different scope.  The extent of that
   scope is not carried in the signal.

   For instance, policy limits might apply at a network subscription
   level, such that multiple flows receive the same signal, but usage
   all contributes to a shared policy limit.

   Endpoints can therefore be more confident in the throughput signal as
   an indication of the maximum achievable throughput than as any
   indication of expected throughput.  In addition to endpoints
   respecting congestion signals (see Section 3.1), networks might need
   to monitor and enforce policies, even where applications attempt to
   follow advice (see Section 7.3).

   The advised throughput will likely only be achievable when the
   application is the only user of throughput within the scope that the
   advice applies to.  In the presence of other flows, congestion limits
   are likely to determine actual throughput.

   This implies that signals can most usefully be applied to a downlink
   flow in access networks, close to an endpoint.  In that case,
   capacity is less likely to be split between multiple active flows.

3.3.  Per-Flow Signal

   The same UDP address tuple might be used for multiple QUIC
   connections.  A single signal might be lost or only reach a single
   application endpoint.  Network elements can apply SCONE advice to all
   QUIC connections that include SCONE packets to ensure that advice is
   received by all application endpoints.

   The signaled advice applies to the flow of packets on the same UDP
   address tuple for the duration of the current monitoring period,
   unless it is updated earlier or the flow ends; see Section 5.2 for
   details on the monitoring period.

   Rate limiting policies often apply on the level of a device or
   subscription, but endpoints cannot assume that this is the case.  A
   separate signal can be sent for each flow.

3.4.  Undirectional Signal

   Throughput advice is signaled with SCONE packets that are transmitted
   as part of the flow that the advice applies to.  Carrying signals in
   the affected flow, in the same way that ECN signals are conveyed,
   ensures that there is no ambiguity about what flow is affected.
   However, this means that the endpoint that receives throughput advice
   is not the endpoint that might need to adapt its sending behavior.

   A receiving endpoint might need to communicate the value it receives
   to the sending peer in order to ensure that the limit is respected.
   This document does not define how that signaling occurs as this is
   specific to the application in use.

3.5.  Advisory Signal

   Throughput advice indicates what one part of the network expects to
   be achievable for flows that transit that portion of the network.  It
   is possible that very different throughput is achievable -- either
   higher or lower than the advice -- as determined by congestion
   control.  Endpoints that receive this signal therefore need to treat
   the information as advisory.

   The fact that an endpoint requests throughput advice does not
   necessarily mean that it will adhere to it; in some cases, the
   endpoint cannot.  For example, a flow may initially be used to serve
   video chunks, with the client selecting appropriate chunks based on
   received advice, but later switch to a bulk download for which
   bitrate adaptation that cannot be similarly controlled.  Composite
   flows from multiple applications, such as tunneled flows, might only
   have a subset of the involved applications that are capable of
   handling SCONE signals.  Therefore, when a network element detects
   that throughput exceeds the advertised throughput advice, it might
   switch to applying its policies for non-SCONE flows, using congestion
   control signals.

   Network conditions and rate-limit policies can change in ways that
   make previously signaled advice obsolete.  For example, routing
   changes can cause a flow to move to a different network path.  There
   are no guarantees that updated advice will be sent at such events.

3.6.  Following Advice

   The SCONE throughput advice is advisory (see Section 3.5).
   Applications that chose to follow it will do so in the way that best
   suits their needs.

   The most obvious way to follow throughput advice is to inform the
   sending peer of the advice so that the peer can adjust send rates as
   necessary.  This document does not provide specific guidance on how
   applications might adapt their use of network capacity in response to
   advice.

   Some applications offer options for rate control that can offer
   improved performance when following advice.  For instance, real-time
   and streaming video applications can often adapt usage.  Typical HTTP
   Live Streaming [HLS] or DASH [DASH] clients are provided with
   manifests that allow them to adjust the bitrate and quality of media
   segments based on available network capacity.  Low priority bulk
   transfer applications, such as software updates, might also choose to
   follow advice.

   Following throughput advice could reduce the impact of an application
   on other network users, reserves capacity for high-priority
   activities, and could avoid potential enforcement action by the
   network; see Section 7.3.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [BCP14] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as
   shown here.

5.  SCONE Packet

   A SCONE packet is a QUIC long header packet that follows the QUIC
   invariants; see Section 5.1 of [INVARIANTS].

   Figure 2 shows the format of the SCONE packet using the conventions
   from Section 4 of [INVARIANTS].

   SCONE Packet {
     Header Form (1) = 1,
     Reserved (1),
     Rate Signal High Bits (6),
     Version (32) = 0x6f7dc0fd or 0xef7dc0fd,
     Destination Connection ID Length (8),
     Destination Connection ID (0..2040),
     Source Connection ID Length (8),
     Source Connection ID (0..2040),
   }

                       Figure 2: SCONE Packet Format

   The most significant bit (0x80) of the packet indicates that this is
   a QUIC long header packet.  The next bit (0x40) is reserved and can
   be set according to [QUIC-BIT].

   The Rate Signal High Bits field consists of the low six bits (0x3f)
   of the first byte.  Together with the most significant bit of the
   Version field, this forms the 7-bit Rate Signal.  Values for the Rate
   Signal are described in Section 5.1.

   The Version field contains either 0x6f7dc0fd or 0xef7dc0fd.  The only
   difference between these two values is the most significant bit,
   which also contributes to the Rate Signal.  All other bits are
   identical, which facilitates detection and modification of SCONE
   packets.

   This packet includes a Destination Connection ID field that is set to
   the same value as other packets in the same datagram; see
   Section 12.2 of [QUIC].

   The Source Connection ID field is set to match the Source Connection
   ID field of any packet that follows.  If the next packet in the
   datagram does not have a Source Connection ID field, which is the
   case for packets with a short header (Section 5.2 of [INVARIANTS]),
   the Source Connection ID field is empty.

   SCONE packets MUST be included as the first packet in a datagram.
   This is primarily to simplify the process of updating throughput
   advice in network elements.  This is also necessary in many cases for
   QUIC versions 1 and 2 because packets with a short header cannot
   precede any other packets.

5.1.  Rate Signals

   A Rate Signal is a 7-bit unsigned integer (0-127).  The high six bits
   are the Rate Signal High Bits, and the least significant bit is the
   most significant bit of the Version field.

   When sent by a QUIC endpoint, the Rate Signal is set to 127.
   Receiving a value of 127 indicates that throughput advice is unknown,
   either because network elements on the path are not providing advice
   or they do not support SCONE.  All other values (0 through 126)
   represent the ceiling of rates advised by the network element(s) on
   the path.

   Throughput advice follows a logarithmic scale defined as:

   *  Base rate (b_min) = 100 Kbps

   *  Bitrate at value n = b_min * 10^(n/20)

   where n is an integer between 0 and 126 represented by the Rate
   Signal.

   Table 1 lists some of the potential values for signals and the
   corresponding bitrate for each.

                            SCONE signals and
                           corresponding rates

5.2.  Monitoring Period

   The time over which throughput advice applies is defined to be a
   period of 67 seconds.

   Protocol participants can use a different period, depending on their
   role.  Senders can limit their send rate over any time period up to
   67 seconds.  Network elements can monitor and apply limits to send
   rates using time period of at least 67 seconds.

   The choice of 67 seconds is a compromise between competing interests.
   Longer periods allow applications more flexibility in terms of how to
   allocate bandwidth over time.  Shorter periods allow networks to
   administer policies more tightly.  Also, when circumstances change,
   applications are better able recover without exceeding limits for a
   significant time if they have exceeded limits.

   The choice of 67 seconds, as a prime number, also helps avoid
   synchronization with other periodic effects that are commonly
   measured in whole seconds.  This includes segment length or key frame
   intervals in video applications, but also includes timers for
   middleboxes; see Section 4.3 of [RFC4787].  Any repeating phenomenon
   at a 67 second interval is therefore unlikely to be due to other
   periodic effects.

5.3.  Endpoint Processing of SCONE Packets

   Processing a SCONE packet involves reading the value from the Rate
   Signal field.  However, this value MUST NOT be used unless another
   packet from the same datagram is successfully processed.  Therefore,
   a SCONE packet always needs to be coalesced with other QUIC packets.

   A SCONE packet is defined by the use of the long header bit (0x80 in
   the first byte) and the SCONE protocol version (0x6f7dc0fd or
   0xef7dc0fd in the next four bytes).  The 7-bit Rate Signal can be
   extracted by combining the low 6 bits of the first byte with the most
   significant bit of the version field.  A SCONE packet MAY be
   discarded, along with any packets that come after it in the same
   datagram, if the Source Connection ID is not consistent with those
   coalesced packets, as specified in Section 5.

   A SCONE packet is discarded if the rate signal is unknown (127).

   A SCONE packet MUST be discarded if the Destination Connection ID
   does not match one recognized by the receiving endpoint.

   If a connection uses multiple DSCP markings [RFC2474], the throughput
   advice that is received on datagrams with one marking might not apply
   to datagrams that have different markings.

5.4.  Following Throughput Advice

   Endpoints that receive throughput advice can advise their peer of the
   limit so that the peer might limit the amount of data it sends over
   any monitoring period (Section 5.2).  Alternatively, the endpoint
   might change its own behavior to effect a similar outcome indirectly,
   which might use flow control or changes to request patterns.

   An endpoint that receives throughput advice might receive multiple
   different values.  If advice is applied by applications, applications
   MUST apply the lowest throughput advice received during any
   monitoring period; see Section 5.2.

   After a monitoring period (Section 5.2) without receiving throughput
   advice, any previous advice expires.  Endpoints can remove any
   constraints placed on throughput based on receiving throughput
   advice.  This does not mean that there are no limits, either in
   policy or due to network conditions, only that these limits are now
   unknown.  Other constraints on usage will still apply, which
   necessarily includes congestion control and might include other,
   application-specific constraints.

   The relatively long duration of the monitoring period means that this
   is preferable to disabling sending completely.  The cost is that loss
   of information about recent send rate might result in temporarily
   exceeding the rates indicated by throughput advice.  In comparison,
   applications retain throughput usage state when throughput advice
   increases.

   This approach ensures that network elements are able to reduce the
   frequency with which they send updated signals to as low as once per
   monitoring period.  However, applying signals at a low frequency
   risks throughput advice being reset if no SCONE packet is available
   for applying signals (Section 7.1), or the rewritten packets are
   lost.  Sending the signal multiple times increases the likelihood
   that the signal is received.

6.  Negotiating SCONE

   A QUIC endpoint indicates that it is able to receive SCONE packets by
   including the scone_supported transport parameter (0x219e).

   Each endpoint independently indicates willingness to receive SCONE
   packets.  An endpoint that does not include the scone_supported
   transport parameter can send SCONE packets if their peer includes the
   transport parameter.

   The scone_supported transport parameter MUST be empty.  Receiving a
   non-zero length scone_supported transport parameter MUST be treated
   as a connection error of type TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR; see
   Section 20.1 of [QUIC].

   This transport parameter is valid for QUIC versions 1 [QUIC] and 2
   [QUICv2] and any other version that recognizes the versions,
   transport parameters, and frame types registries established in
   Sections 22.2, 22.3, and 22.4 of [QUIC].

6.1.  Indicating Support on New Flows

   All new flows that are initiated by a client that supports SCONE MUST
   include bytes with values 0xc8 and 0x13 as the last two bytes of
   datagrams that commence a new flow if the protocol permits it.  This
   indication MUST be sent in every datagram until the client receives
   any datagram from the server, at which point the client can be
   confident that the indication was received.

   A client that uses a QUIC version that sends length-delimited packets
   during the handshake, which includes QUIC versions 1 [QUIC] and 2
   [QUICv2], can include an indicator of SCONE support outside of the
   QUIC packets at the end of datagrams that start a flow.  The
   handshakes of these protocols ensures that the indication can be
   included in every datagram the client sends until it receives a
   response -- of any kind -- from the server.

6.2.  Limitations of Indication

   This indication does not mean that SCONE signals will be respected,
   only that the client is able to negotiate SCONE.  A server might not
   support SCONE and either endpoint might choose not to send SCONE
   packets.  Finally, applications might be unable to apply throughput
   advice or choose to ignore it.

   This indication being just two bytes means that there is a non-
   negligible risk of collision with other protocols or even QUIC usage
   without SCONE indications.  This means that the indication alone is
   not sufficient to indicate that a flow is QUIC with the potential for
   SCONE support.

   Despite these limitations, having an indication might allow network
   elements to change their starting posture with respect to their
   enforcement of their rate limit policies.

6.3.  Indications for Migrated Flows

   Applications MAY decide to indicate support for SCONE on new flows,
   including when migrating to a new path (see Section 9 of [QUIC]).  In
   QUIC version 1 and 2, the two byte indicator cannot be used.

   Sending a SCONE packet for the first few packets on a new path gives
   network elements on that path the ability to recognize the flow as
   being able to receive throughput advice and also gives the network
   element an opportunity to provide that throughput advice.

   To enable this indication, even if an endpoint would not otherwise
   send SCONE packets, endpoints can send a SCONE packet any time they
   send a QUIC PATH_CHALLENGE or PATH_RESPONSE frame.  This applies to
   both client and server endpoints, but only if the peer has sent the
   transport parameter; see Section 6.

7.  Network Deployment

   QUIC endpoints can enable the use of the SCONE protocol by sending
   SCONE packets Section 5.  Network elements can then use SCONE and
   replace the Rate Signal field (Section 7.1) according to their
   policies.

7.1.  Applying Throughput Advice Signals

   A network element detects a SCONE packet by observing that a packet
   has a QUIC long header and one of the SCONE protocol versions
   (0x6f7dc0fd or 0xef7dc0fd).

   A network element then conditionally replaces the most significant
   bit of the Version field and the Rate Signal High Bits field with
   values of its choosing.

   A network element might receive a packet that already includes a rate
   signal.  The network element replaces the rate signal if it wishes to
   signal a lower value for throughput advice; otherwise, the original
   values are retained, preserving the signal from the network element
   with the lower policy.

   The following pseudocode indicates how a network element might detect
   a SCONE packet and replace the existing rate signal (packet_signal)
   with a new rate signal (target_signal) that encodes the throughput
   advice of this network element.

   is_long = packet[0] & 0x80 == 0x80
   packet_version = ntohl(packet[1..5])
   if is_long and (packet_version & 0x7fffffff) == SCONE_VERSION_BITS:
     packet_signal = ((packet[0] & 0x3f) << 1) | (packet_version >> 31)
     if target_signal < packet_signal:
       packet[0] = (packet[0] & 0xc0) | (target_signal >> 1)
       packet[1] = (packet[1] & 0x7f) | (target_signal << 7)

   Once the throughput advice signal is updated, the network element
   updates the UDP checksum for the datagram.

   To avoid throughput advice expiring, a network element needs to
   ensure that it sends updated rate signals with no more than a
   monitoring period (Section 5.2) between each update.  Because this
   depends on the availability of SCONE packets and packet loss can
   cause signals to be missed, network elements might need to update
   more often.  Ideally, network elements update advice in SCONE packets
   at least twice per monitoring period, to match endpoint behavior (see
   Section 8.1).

   At the start of a flow, network elements are encouraged to update the
   rate signal of the first few SCONE packets it observes so that
   endpoints can obtain throughput advice early.

   Senders that send a SCONE packet or network elements that update
   SCONE packets every 20–30 seconds is likely sufficient to ensure that
   throughput advice is not lost.  To reduce the risk of synchronization
   across multiple senders, which may cause network elements to miss
   updates, senders can include a small random delay.

   A network element MUST NOT alter datagrams to add SCONE packets or
   synthesize datagrams that contain SCONE packets.  The latter will not
   be accepted and the former, even if they do not exceed the path MTU
   as a result, can be detected by applications and could be ignored.
   This document does not define a mechanism to support detection, but
   one might be added in future.

7.2.  Monitoring Flows

   Sending throughput advice is optional for any network.  A network
   that sends throughput advice might, also optionally, choose to
   monitor flows to determine whether applications are following advice.

   This section outlines a method that a network element could use to
   determine whether advice is being followed.  Network deployments that
   choose to monitor are free to follow any monitoring regime that suits
   their needs.

   This monitoring algorithm is guidance only.  However, monitoring any
   more strictly than the following could mean that an application might
   be incorrectly classified as not following advice.  A looser
   monitoring approach, such as monitoring over a longer time window
   than the monitoring period (67s) or using a higher rate than is
   signaled, has no risk of incorrect classification.

   When a network changes the value it intends to signal, applications
   need time to adjust their sending behavior.  As a result, any
   monitoring needs to allow time for SCONE packets to be updated, for
   those packets to be received by endpoints, and for applications to
   adapt.

   A network element can then monitor affected flows to determine
   whether the throughput advice it provided was followed.

   A network element SHOULD base its monitoring on the maximum value
   that was configured to apply during the preceding two monitoring
   periods.  If the network element cannot update the throughput advice
   in every SCONE packet (or can do so only infrequently), a longer
   period might be used to account for the possibility that the updated
   SCONE packets are lost.  This allows applications time to receive
   advice and adapt their sending rate.

   Any monitoring and policy enforcement could be implemented in
   different network elements than the ones that signal throughput
   advice.  However, network elements MUST NOT enforce throughput based
   on throughput advice found in SCONE packets received from other
   entities, because unlike endpoints, network elements do not have the
   capability to validate other QUIC packets contained in the same
   datagram; see Section 9.1.

7.3.  Flows That Exceed Throughput Advice

   A network could deploy policy enforcement that drops or delays
   packets to ensure that applications do not exceed throughput limits
   set in policy.

   SCONE allows networks to provide advice to applications, so that
   stricter limits, which can be inefficient and lead to worse
   application performance, are not necessary in all cases.

   Some applications will not support SCONE.  Other applications either
   will not or cannot follow throughput advice.

   Networks can monitor flows to determine if applications follow
   advice; see Section 7.2.  A network could choose to either disable or
   loosen policy enforcement for flows where SCONE is active, but re-
   enable or tighten enforcement if monitoring indicates that throughput
   advice is not being respected.

8.  Endpoint Usage

   The SCONE protocol defines two versions (0x6f7dc0fd and 0xef7dc0fd)
   that combined carry throughput advice that covers a range of bitrates
   between 100 Kbps and 199.5 Gbps.

8.1.  Providing Opportunities to Apply Throughput Advice Signals

   Endpoints that wish to offer network elements the option to add
   throughput advice signals can send SCONE packets at any time.  This
   is a decision that a sender makes when constructing datagrams.

   When sending SCONE packets, endpoints MUST include the SCONE packet
   as the first packet in a datagram, coalesced with additional packets.

   Upon confirmation that the peer is willing to receive SCONE packets,
   an endpoint SHOULD include SCONE packets in the first few UDP
   datagrams that it sends.  Doing so increases the likelihood of
   eliciting early throughput advice from network elements, allowing
   applications to apply that advice from the early stages of the data
   transfer.

   After that, endpoints that seek to receive throughput advice on a
   flow MUST send a SCONE packet at least twice each monitoring period;
   see Section 5.2.

   Sending SCONE packets more often might be necessary to:

   Avoid missing advice:  If SCONE packets are not sent, updated, and
      received for an entire monitoring period, an application might
      incorrectly assume that no advice is being provided.

   Reduce latency:  The time between SCONE packets determines the
      maximum delay between changes in throughput advice and when that
      advice can be received and acted upon.

   A sender can track the receipt of the coalesced QUIC packet and send
   another SCONE packet when loss is detected.  However, it is likely
   simpler to send SCONE packets more often.

   Sending a SCONE packet every 20–30 seconds is likely sufficient to
   ensure that throughput advice is not lost, though endpoints might
   send a packet every few seconds to improve responsiveness.  This
   period could be determined by how quickly an application is able to
   respond to a change in throughput advice.

   For example, a streaming application that fetches video segments that
   are 5 seconds in length might send SCONE packets on a similar
   cadence.  A real-time conferencing application might send more often.
   In either case, the length of the monitoring period (Section 5.2)
   limits how fast any application can react.

   Though sending SCONE packets more than once each round trip time
   might help reduce exposure to packet loss, it is better to spread
   updates over time rather than to send multiple SCONE packets in less
   frequent bursts.

   The main cost associated with sending SCONE packets is the reduction
   in available space in datagrams for application data.

   A network element that wishes to signal updated throughput advice
   waits for the next SCONE packet in the desired direction; see
   Section 7.1.

8.2.  Feedback To Sender About Signals

   Information about throughout advice is intended for the sending
   application.  Any signal from network elements can be propagated to
   the receiving application using an implementation-defined mechanism.

   This document does not define a means for indicating what was
   received.  That is, the expectation is that any signal is propagated
   to the application for handling, not handled automatically by the
   transport layer.  How a receiving application communicates the
   throughput advice signal to a sending application will depend on the
   application in use.

   Different applications can choose different approaches.  For example,
   in an application where a receiver drives rate adaptation, it might
   not be necessary to define additional signaling.

   A sender can use any acknowledgment mechanism provided by the QUIC
   version in use to learn whether datagrams containing SCONE packets
   were likely received.  This might help inform whether to send
   additional SCONE packets in the event that a datagram is lost.
   However, rather than relying on transport signals, an application
   might be better able to indicate what has been received and
   processed.

   SCONE packets could be stripped from datagrams in the network, which
   cannot be reliably detected.  This could result in a sender falsely
   believing that no network element applied a throughput advice signal.
   Senders will therefore proceed as though there was no advice.

8.3.  Interactions with Congestion Control

   SCONE and congestion control both provide the application with
   estimates of a path capacity.  They are complementary.  Congestion
   control algorithms are typically designed to quickly detect and react
   to congestion, i.e., to the "minimum" capacity of a path.  SCONE
   informs the endpoint of the maximum capacity of a path based on
   network rate limit policy, network conditions, or a combination of
   the two.

   Consider for example a path in which the bottleneck router implements
   some form of Explicit Congestion Notification [ECN].  If the path
   capacity diminishes, queues will build up and the router will
   immediately start increasing the rate at which packets are marked as
   "Congestion Experienced".  The receiving endpoint will notice these
   marks, and inform its peer.  The incoming congestion will be detected
   in 1 round trip time (RTT).  This scenario will play out whatever the
   reason for the change in capacity, whether due to increased
   competition between multiple applications or, for example, to a
   change in capacity of a wireless channel.

9.  Security Considerations

   The modification of packets provides endpoints proof that a network
   element is in a position to drop datagrams and could apply a rate
   limit policy.  Section 8.1 states that endpoints only accept signals
   if the datagram contains a packet that it accepts to prevent an off-
   path attacker from inserting spurious throughput advice signals.

   Some off-path attackers may be able to both observe traffic and
   inject packets.  Attackers with such capabilities could observe
   packets sent by an endpoint, create datagrams coalescing an arbitrary
   SCONE packet and the observed packet, and send these datagrams such
   that they arrive at the peer endpoint before the original packet.
   Spoofed packets that seek to advertise a higher limit than might
   otherwise be permitted also need to bypass any rate limiters.  The
   attacker will thus get arbitrary SCONE packets accepted by the peer,
   with the result being that the endpoint receives a false or
   misleading rate limit.

   The recipient of a throughput advice signal therefore cannot
   guarantee that the signal was generated by an on-path network
   element.  However, the capabilities required of an off-path attacker
   are substantially similar to those of on path elements.

   The actual value of the throughput advice signal is not
   authenticated.  Any signal might be incorrectly set in order to
   encourage endpoints to behave in ways that are not in their
   interests.  Endpoints are free to ignore limits that they think are
   incorrect.  The congestion controller employed by a sender provides
   real-time information about the rate at which the network path is
   delivering data.

   Similarly, if there is a strong need to ensure that throughput advice
   is respected, network elements cannot assume that the signaled advice
   will be respected by endpoints.

9.1.  Fake SCONE Packets

   Attackers that can inject packets could compose arbitrary "SCONE-
   like" packets by selecting a pair of IP addresses and ports, an
   arbitrary rate signal, a valid SCONE version number, an arbitrary
   "destination connection ID", and an arbitrary "source connection ID".
   A coalesced "1RTT" packet will start with a plausible first octet,
   and continue with the selected destination connection ID followed by
   a sufficiently long series of random bytes, mimicking the content of
   an encrypted packet.

   Endpoints will reject such packets because they do not contain valid
   QUIC packets, but network elements cannot detect this.  All the
   network elements between the injection point and the destination will
   have to process these packets.

   Attackers could send a high volume of these "fake" SCONE packets in a
   denial of service (DOS) attempt against network elements.  The attack
   will force the intermediaries to process the fake packets.  If
   network elements are keeping state for ongoing SCONE flows, this
   might exhaust memory resources.  The mitigation is the same as for
   other distributed DOS attacks: limit the rate of SCONE packets that a
   network element is willing to process; possibly, implement logic to
   distinguish valid SCONE packets from fake packets; or, use generic
   protection against Distributed DOS attacks.

   Attackers could also try to craft the fake SCONE packets in ways that
   trigger a processing error at network elements.  For example, they
   might pick connection identifiers of arbitrary length.  Network
   elements can mitigate these attacks with an implementation that fully
   conforms to the specification of Section 5.

9.2.  Damage to Other Protocols

   Network elements that update SCONE packet fields might do that for
   datagrams exchanged in other protocols.  This could result in damage
   to those protocols.

   The most serious damage occurs when every datagram is modified,
   because that could mean that the protocol is effectively unable to
   operate end-to-end.

   To that end, network elements MUST only update the content of
   datagrams on a given address tuple a few times each monitoring
   period.  Network elements MAY update more often immediately after a
   change in their throughput advice, to reduce the reaction time from
   senders.

   In addition, some heuristics might be used to detect SCONE-compatible
   QUIC flows.  This includes identification of a QUIC handshake on the
   flow, the presence of indications (Section 6.1), or other heuristics.
   If these heuristics indicate a non-QUIC flow, the safest option is
   for network elements to disable updating of datagrams.

10.  Privacy Considerations

   The focus of this analysis is the extent to which observing SCONE
   packets could be used to gain information about endpoints.  This
   might be leaking details of how applications using QUIC operate or
   leaks of endpoint identity when using additional privacy protection,
   such as a VPN.

   Any network element that can observe the content of that packet can
   read the throughput advice that was applied.  Any signal is visible
   on the path, from the point at which it is applied to the point at
   which it is consumed at an endpoint.  On path elements can also alter
   the SCONE signal to try trigger specific reactions and gain further
   knowledge.

   In the general case of a client connected to a server through the
   Internet, we believe that SCONE does not provide much advantage to
   attackers.  The identities of the clients and servers are already
   visible through their IP addresses.  Traffic analysis tools already
   provide more information than the throughput advice set by SCONE.

   There are two avenues of attack that require more analysis:

   *  that the passive observation of SCONE packets might help identify
      or distinguish endpoints; and

   *  that active manipulation of SCONE signals might help reveal the
      identity of endpoints that are otherwise hidden behind VPNs or
      proxies.

10.1.  Passive Attacks

   If only few clients and server pairs negotiate the usage of SCONE,
   the occasional observation of SCONE packets will "stick out".  That
   observation, could be combined with observation of timing and volume
   of traffic to help identify the endpoint or categorize the
   application that they are using.

   A variation of this issue occurs if SCONE is widely implemented, but
   only used in some specific circumstances.  In that case, observation
   of SCONE packets reveals information about the state of the endpoint.

   If multiple servers are accessed through the same front facing
   server, Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) may be used to prevent outside
   parties to identify which specific server a client is using.
   However, if only a few of these servers use SCONE, any SCONE packets
   will help identify which specific server a client is using.

   This issue will be mitigated if SCONE becomes widely implemented, and
   if the usage of SCONE is not limited to the type of applications that
   make active use of the signal.

   QUIC implementations are therefore encouraged to make the feature
   available unconditionally.  Endpoints might send SCONE packets
   whenever a peer can accept them.

10.2.  Active Attacks

   Suppose a configuration in which multiple clients use a VPN or proxy
   service to access the same server.  The attacker sees the IP
   addresses in the packets behind VPN and proxy and also between the
   users and the VPN, but it does not know which VPN address corresponds
   to what user address.

   Suppose now that the attacker selects a flow on the link between the
   VPN/proxy and server.  The attacker applies throughput advice signals
   to SCONE packets in that flow.  The attacker chooses a bandwidth that
   is lower than the "natural" bandwidth of the connection.  A reduction
   in the rate of flows between client and VPN/proxy might allow the
   attacker to link the altered flow to the client.

   +--------+
   | Client |------.
   +--------+       \      +-------+
                     '---->|       |            +--------+
   +--------+              |  VPN  |<==========>|        |
   | Client |------------->|   /   |<==========>| Server |
   +--------+              | Proxy |<==========>|        |
                     .---->|       |     ^      +--------+
   +--------+       /      +-------+     |
   | Client |======'                     |
   +--------+      ^           Apply throughput advice signal
                    \
                     \
                  Observe change

   An attacker that can manipulate SCONE headers can also simulate
   congestion signals by dropping packets or by setting the ECN CE bit.
   That will also likely result in changes in the congestion response by
   the affected client.

   A VPN or proxy could defend against this style of attack by removing
   SCONE (and ECN) signals.  There are few reasons to provide per-flow
   throughput advice signals in that situation.  Endpoints might also
   either disable this feature or ignore any signals when they are aware
   of the use of a VPN or proxy.
