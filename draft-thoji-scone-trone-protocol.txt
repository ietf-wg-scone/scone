1.  Introduction

   Many access networks limit the maximum data rate that attached
   devices are able to attain.  This is often done without any
   indication to the applications running on devices.  The result can be
   that application performance is degraded, as the manner in which rate
   limits are enforced can be incompatible with the rate estimation or
   congestion control algorithms used at endpoints.

   Having the network indicate what its rate limiting policy is, in a
   way that is accessible to endpoints, might allow applications to use
   this information when adapting their send rate.

   The Transparent Rate Optimization for Network Endpoints (TRONE)
   protocol is negotiated by QUIC endpoints.  This protocol provides a
   means for network elements to signal the maximum available sustained
   throughput, or rate limits, for flows of UDP datagrams that transit
   that network element to a QUIC endpoint.

2.  Overview

   QUIC endpoints can negotiate the use of TRONE by including a
   transport parameter (Section 6) in the QUIC handshake.  Endpoints
   then occasionally coalesce a TRONE packet with ordinary QUIC packets
   that they send.

   Network elements that have rate limiting policies can detect flows
   that include TRONE packets.  The network element can indicate a
   maximum sustained throughput by modifying the TRONE packet as it
   transits the network element.

   +--------+    +---------+     +----------+
   |  QUIC  |    | Network |     |   QUIC   |
   | Sender |    | Element |     | Receiver |
   +---+----+    +----+----+     +----+-----+
       |              |               |
       +--- TRONE --->|   TRONE+rate  |
       |    +QUIC     +---- +QUIC --->|
       |              |               |  Validate QUIC packet
       |              |               |  and record rate
       |              |               |

   QUIC endpoints that receive modified TRONE packets observe the
   indicated version, process the QUIC packet, and then record the
   indicated rate.

   Indicated rate limits apply only in a single direction.  Separate
   indications can be sent for the client-to-server direction and
   server-to-client direction.  The indicated rates do not need to be
   the same.

   Indicated rate limits only apply to the path on which they are
   received.  A connection that migrates or uses multipath [QUIC-MP]
   cannot assume that rate limit indications from one path apply to new
   paths.

3.  Applicability

   This protocol only works for flows that use the TRONE packet
   (Section 5).

   The protocol requires that packets are modified as they transit a
   network element, which provides endpoints strong evidence that the
   network element has the power to drop packets; though see Section 9
   for potential limitations on this.

   The rate limit signal that this protocol carries is independent of
   congestion signals, limited to a single path and UDP packet flow,
   unidirectional, and strictly advisory.

3.1.  Independent of Congestion Signals

   Rate limit signals are not a substitute for congestion feedback.
   Congestion signals, such as acknowledgments, provide information on
   loss, delay, or ECN markings [ECN] that indicate the real-time
   condition of a network path.  Congestion signals might indicate a
   throughput that is different from the signaled rate limit.

   Endpoints cannot assume that a signaled rate limit is achievable if
   congestion signals indicate otherwise.  Congestion could be
   experienced at a different point on the network path than the network
   element that indicates a rate limit.  Therefore, endpoints need to
   respect the send rate constraints that are set by a congestion
   controller.

3.2.  Unspecified Scope

   Modifying a packet does not prove that the rate limit that is
   indicated would be achievable.  A signal that is sent for a specific
   flow is likely enforced at a different scope.  The extent of that
   scope is not carried in the signal.

   For instance, limits might apply at a network subscription level,
   such that multiple flows receive the same signal.

   Endpoints can therefore be more confident in the rate limit signal as
   an indication of the maximum achievable throughput than as any
   indication of expected throughput.  That throughput will only be
   achievable when there is no significant data flowing in the same
   scope.  In the presence of other flows, congestion limits are likely
   to determine actual throughput.

   This makes the application of signals most usefully applied to a
   downlink flow in access networks, close to an endpoint.  In that
   case, capacity is less likely to be split between multiple active
   flows.

3.3.  Per-Flow Signal

   The same UDP address tuple might be used for multiple QUIC
   connections.  A single signal might be lost or only reach a single
   application endpoint.  Network elements that signal about a flow
   might choose to send additional signals, using connection IDs to
   indicate when new connections could be involved.

3.4.  Undirectional Signal

   The endpoint that receives a rate limit signal is not the endpoint
   that might adapt its sending behavior as a result of receiving the
   signal.  This ensures that the rate limit signal is attached to the
   flow that it is mostly likely to apply to.

   An endpoint might need to communicate the value it receives to its
   peer in order to ensure that the limit is respected.  This document
   does not define how that signaling occurs as this is specific to the
   application in use.

3.5.  Advisory Signal

   A signal does not prove that a higher rate would not be successful.
   Endpoints that receive this signal therefore need to treat the
   information as advisory.

   As an advisory signal, network elements cannot assume that endpoints
   will respect the signal.  Though this might reduce the need for more
   active rate limiting, how rate limit enforcement is applied is a
   matter for network policy.

   The time and scope over which a rate limit applies is not specified.
   The effective rate limit might change without being signaled.  The
   signaled limit can be assumed to apply to the flow of packets on the
   same UDP address tuple for the duration of that flow.  Rate limiting
   policies often apply on the level of a device or subscription, but
   endpoints cannot assume that this is the case.  A separate signal can
   be sent for each flow.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [BCP14] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as
   shown here.

5.  TRONE Packet

   A TRONE packet is a QUIC long header packet that follows the QUIC
   invariants; see Section 5.1 of [INVARIANTS].

   Figure 1 shows the format of the TRONE packet using the conventions
   from Section 4 of [INVARIANTS].

   TRONE Packet {
     Header Form (1) = 1,
     Reserved (1),
     Rate Signal (6),
     Version (32) = 0xTRONE1 or 0xTRONE2,
     Destination Connection ID Length (8),
     Destination Connection ID (0..2040),
     Source Connection ID Length (8),
     Source Connection ID (0..2040),
   }

                       Figure 1: TRONE Packet Format

   The most significant bit (0x80) of the packet indicates that this is
   a QUIC long header packet.  The next bit (0x40) is reserved and can
   be set according to [QUIC-BIT].

   The low 6 bits (0x3f) of the first byte contain the Rate Signal
   field.  Values for this field are described in Section 5.1.

   This packet includes a Destination Connection ID field that is set to
   the same value as other packets in the same datagram; see
   Section 12.2 of [QUIC].

   The Source Connection ID field is set to match the Source Connection
   ID field of any packet that follows.  If the next packet in the
   datagram does not have a Source Connection ID field, which is the
   case for packets with a short header (Section 5.2 of [INVARIANTS]),
   the Source Connection ID field is empty.

   TRONE packets SHOULD be included as the first packet in a datagram.
   This is necessary in many cases for QUIC versions 1 and 2 because
   packets with a short header cannot precede any other packets.

5.1.  Rate Signals

   The Rate Signal field in TRONE uses the low 6 bits (0x3f) of the
   first byte.  This field is encoded as a logarithmically spaced
   distribution over a range defined by the TRONE protocol version.

   The Rate Signal field is set to 0x3F (63) when sent by a QUIC
   endpoint, indicating no rate limit is in place or that the TRONE
   protocol is not supported by network elements on the path.  Vales
   0x00 through 0x3E (62) represent the ceiling of rate being advised by
   the network element(s) on the path.

   For TRONE protocol version 0xTRONE1, the rate limits use a
   logarithmic scale with: * Base rate (b_min) = 100 Kbps * Maximum rate
   ≈ 125 Mbps * Bitrate at value n = b_min * 10^(n/20)

   For TRONE protocol version 0xTRONE2, the rate limits use a
   logarithmic scale with: * Base rate (b_min) = 10000 Kbps (10 Mbps) *
   Maximum rate ≈ 12.5 Gbps * Bitrate at value n = b_min * 10^(n/20)

   This creates two overlapping ranges: * Version 0xTRONE1: 100 Kbps to
   125 Mbps * Version 0xTRONE2: 10 Mbps to 12.5 Gbps

   Some notable values in these ranges include:

      +=============+=======================+=======================+
      | Rate Signal | Version 0xTRONE1 Rate | Version 0xTRONE2 Rate |
      +=============+=======================+=======================+
      | 0           | 100 Kbps              | 10 Mbps               |
      +-------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
      | 10          | 316 Kbps              | 31.6 Mbps             |
      +-------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
      | 20          | 1 Mbps                | 100 Mbps              |

      | 30          | 3.16 Mbps             | 316 Mbps              |

      | 40          | 10 Mbps               | 1 Gbps                |
      +-------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
      | 50          | 31.6 Mbps             | 3.16 Gbps             |

      | 62          | 126 Mbps              | 12.6 Gbps             |
      +-------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
      | 63          | No limit              | No limit              |

5.2.  Endpoint Processing of TRONE Packets

   Processing a TRONE packet involves reading the value from the Rate
   Signal field.  However, this value MUST NOT be used unless another
   packet from the same datagram is successfully processed.  Therefore,
   a TRONE packet always needs to be coalesced with other QUIC packets.

   A TRONE packet is defined by the use of the longer header bit (0x80
   in the first byte) and the TRONE protocol version (0xTBD in the next
   four bytes).  A TRONE packet MAY be discarded, along with any packets
   that come after it in the same datagram, if the Source Connection ID
   is not consistent with those coalesced packets, as specified in
   Section 5.

   A TRONE packet MUST be discarded if the Destination Connection ID
   does not match one recognized by the receiving endpoint.

6.  Negotiating TRONE

   A QUIC endpoint indicates that it is willing to receive TRONE packets
   by including the trone_supported transport parameter (0xTBD).

   This transport parameter is valid for QUIC versions 1 [QUIC] and 2
   [QUICv2] and any other version that recognizes the versions,
   transport parameters, and frame types registries established in
   Sections 22.2, 22.3, and 22.4 of [QUIC].

7.  Deployment

   QUIC endpoints can enable the use of the TRONE protocol by sending
   TRONE packets Section 5.  Network elements then apply or replace the
   Rate Signal field (Section 7.1) according to their policies.

7.1.  Applying Rate Limit Signals

   A network element detects a TRONE packet by observing that a packet
   has a QUIC long header and one of the TRONE protocol versions
   (0xTRONE1 or 0xTRONE2).

   A network element then conditionally replaces the Rate Signal field
   with values of its choosing.

   A network element might receive a packet that already includes a rate
   signal.  The network element replaces the rate signal if it wishes to
   signal a lower rate limit; otherwise, the original values are
   retained, preserving the signal from the network element with the
   lower policy.

   The following pseudocode indicates how a network element might detect
   a TRONE packet and replace an existing rate signal.

   is_long = packet[0] & 0x80 == 0x80
   packet_version = packet[1..5]
   if is_long and (packet_version == TRONE1_VERSION or packet_version == TRONE2_VERSION):
     target_rate_value = convert_rate_to_signal(target_rate, packet_version)
     packet_rate_value = packet[0] & 0x3f
     if packet_rate_value == 0x3f or target_rate_value < packet_rate_value:
       packet[0] = packet[0] & 0xc0 | target_rate_value

   A network element applies the same rate policy to TRONE packets of
   both versions, accounting for the different scales of each version.
   When a network element signals a rate limit that falls within the
   range of both versions, it should signal appropriate values in each
   version.  When the target rate limit is outside the range of a
   particular version, the network element should signal the minimum
   value (0) for rates below the range and preserve the original value
   for rates above the range.

8.  Version Interaction

   The TRONE protocol defines two versions (0xTRONE1 and 0xTRONE2) that
   cover different but overlapping ranges of bitrates.  This design
   allows for:

   *  Support for both very low bitrates (down to 100 Kbps) and very
      high bitrates (up to 12.5 Gbps)

   *  Graceful handling of network elements that might only recognize
      one version or some subset of future versions.

8.1.  Converting Between Versions

   When network elements or endpoints need to compare rate signals from
   different versions, they must first convert the signals to their
   corresponding bitrates.  The formulas for conversion are:

   *  For version 0xTRONE1: bitrate = 100 Kbps * 10^(signal/20)

   *  For version 0xTRONE2: bitrate = 10 Mbps * 10^(signal/20)

8.2.  Handling Multiple Versions

   Endpoints should observe the following guidelines when sending and
   processing TRONE packets:

   *  When sending TRONE packets, endpoints SHOULD alternate between
      versions 0xTRONE1 and 0xTRONE2 to ensure network elements can
      signal rate limits across the entire supported range.

   *  When receiving TRONE packets with different versions, endpoints
      SHOULD:

      -  Convert all signals to their corresponding bitrates

      -  Use the most restrictive (lowest) effective rate limit

      -  If one version's signal indicates "no limit" (value 63) but the
         other indicates a limit, use the specified limit

   *  Network elements SHOULD apply appropriate rate signals to all
      packets that include a TRONE version they support.

8.3.  Example Conversions

   For a target rate limit of 30 Mbps: * In version 0xTRONE1, this
   corresponds to a signal value of approximately 49 * In version
   0xTRONE2, this corresponds to a signal value of approximately 9

   For a target rate limit of 5 Gbps: * In version 0xTRONE1, this
   exceeds the range, so the signal would remain at 63 (no limit) * In
   version 0xTRONE2, this corresponds to a signal value of approximately
   57

8.4.  Providing Opportunities to Apply Rate Limit Signals

   Endpoints that wish to offer network elements the option to add rate
   limit signals can send TRONE packets at any time.  This is a decision
   that a sender makes when constructing datagrams.  It is recommended
   that endpoints promptly send an initial TRONE packet once the peer
   confirms its willingness to receive them.

   To support the full range of possible rate limits, endpoints SHOULD
   alternate between sending TRONE packets with version 0xTRONE1 and
   version 0xTRONE2.  This allows network elements to signal rate limits
   across the entire supported range with appropriate granularity.

   When a receiver receives TRONE packets with different versions and
   different rate signals, it SHOULD use the most restrictive (lowest)
   effective rate limit after converting the signal values to their
   corresponding bitrates.

   Endpoints MUST send any TRONE packet they send as the first packet in
   a datagram, coalesced with additional packets.  An endpoint that
   receives and discards a TRONE packet without also successfully
   processing another packet from the same datagram SHOULD ignore any
   rate limit signal.  Such a datagram might be entirely spoofed.

   A network element that wishes to signal an updated rate limit waits
   for the next TRONE packet in the desired direction.  However, if no
   TRONE packet arrives within a reasonable time, the network element
   MAY construct its own TRONE packet and prepend it to a QUIC packet
   before forwarding.  This process requires expanding the UDP datagram
   containing the original QUIC packet, which might cause the datagram
   to exceed the path MTU.  Therefore, a network element SHOULD NOT
   expand UDP datagrams if the combined payload of the TRONE packet and
   the subsequent packets exceeds 1200 bytes, the smallest maximum
   datagram size supported by QUIC versions 1 and 2 (see Section 14 of
   [QUIC]).

8.5.  Feedback To Sender About Signals

   Information about rate limits is intended for the sending
   application.  Any signal from network elements can be propagated to
   the receiving application using an implementation-defined mechanism.

   This document does not define a means for indicating what was
   received.  That is, the expectation is that any signal is propagated
   to the application for handling, not handled automatically by the
   transport layer.  How a receiving application communicates the rate
   limit signal to a sending application will depend on the application
   in use.

   Different applications can choose different approaches.  For example,
   in an application where a receiver drives rate adaptation, it might
   not be necessary to define additional signaling.

   A sender can use any acknowledgment mechanism provided by the QUIC
   version in use to learn whether datagrams containing TRONE packets
   were likely received.  This might help inform whether to send
   additional TRONE packets in the event that a datagram is lost.
   However, rather than relying on transport signals, an application
   might be better able to indicate what has been received and
   processed.

   TRONE packets could be stripped from datagrams in the network, which
   cannot be reliably detected.  This could result in a sender falsely
   believing that no network element applied a rate limit signal.

9.  Security Considerations

   The modification of packets provides endpoints proof that a network
   element is in a position to drop datagrams and thereby enforce the
   indicated rate limit.  Section 8.4 states that endpoints only accept
   signals if the datagram contains a packet that it accepts to prevent
   an off-path attacker from inserting spurious rate limit signals.

   Some off-path attackers may be able to both observe traffic and
   inject packets.  Attackers with such capabilities could observe
   packets sent by an endpoint, create datagrams coalescing an arbitrary
   TRONE packet and the observed packet, and send these datagrams such
   that they arrive at the peer endpoint before the original packet.
   Spoofed packets that seek to advertise a higher limit than might
   otherwise be permitted also need to bypass any rate limiters.  The
   attacker will thus get arbitrary TRONE packets accepted by the peer,
   with the result being that the endpoint receives a false or
   misleading rate limit.

   The recipient of a rate limit signal therefore cannot guarantee that
   the signal was generated by an on-path network element.  However, the
   capabilities required of an off-path attacker are substantially
   similar to those of on path elements.

   The actual value of the rate limit signal is not authenticated.  Any
   signal might be incorrectly set in order to encourage endpoints to
   behave in ways that are not in their interests.  Endpoints are free
   to ignore limits that they think are incorrect.  The congestion
   controller employed by a sender provides real-time information about
   the rate at which the network path is delivering data.

   Similarly, if there is a strong need to ensure that a rate limit is
   respected, network elements cannot assume that the signaled limit
   will be respected by endpoints.

10.  Privacy Considerations

   The focus of this analysis is the extent to which observing TRONE
   packets could be used to gain information about endpoints.  This
   might be leaking details of how applications using QUIC operate or
   leaks of endpoint identity when using additional privacy protection,
   such as a VPN.

   Any network element that can observe the content of that packet can
   read the rate limit that was applied.  Any signal is visible on the
   path, from the point at which it is applied to the point at which it
   is consumed at an endpoint.  On path elements can also alter the
   TRONE signal to try trigger specific reactions and gain further
   knowledge.

   In the general case of a client connected to a server through the
   Internet, we believe that TRONE does not provide much advantage to
   attackers.  The identities of the clients and servers are already
   visible through their IP addresses.  Traffic analysis tools already
   provide more information than the data rate limits set by TRONE.

   There are two avenues of attack that require more analysis:

   *  that the passive observation of TRONE packets might help identify
      or distinguish endpoints; and

   *  that active manipulation of TRONE signals might help reveal the
      identity of endpoints that are otherwise hidden behind VPNs or
      proxies.

10.1.  Passive Attacks

   If only few clients and server pairs negotiate the usage of TRONE,
   the occasional observation of TRONE packets will "stick out".  That
   observation, could be combined with observation of timing and volume
   of traffic to help identify the endpoint or categorize the
   application that they are using.

   A variation of this issue occurs if TRONE is widely implemented, but
   only used in some specific circumstances.  In that case, observation
   of TRONE packets reveals information about the state of the endpoint.

   If multiple servers are accessed through the same front facing
   server, Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) may be used to prevent outside
   parties to identify which specific server a client is using.
   However, if only a few of these servers use TRONE, any TRONE packets
   will help identify which specific server a client is using.

   This issue will be mitigated if TRONE becomes widely implemented, and
   if the usage of TRONE is not limited to the type of applications that
   make active use of the signal.

   QUIC implementations are therefore encouraged to make the feature
   available unconditionally.  Endpoints might send TRONE packets
   whenever a peer can accept them.

10.2.  Active Attacks

   Suppose a configuration in which multiple clients use a VPN or proxy
   service to access the same server.  The attacker sees the IP
   addresses in the packets behind VPN and proxy and also between the
   users and the VPN, but it does not know which VPN address corresponds
   to what user address.

   Suppose now that the attacker selects a flow on the link between the
   VPN/proxy and server.  The attacker applies rate limit signals to
   TRONE packets in that flow.  The attacker chooses a bandwidth that is
   lower than the "natural" bandwidth of the connection.  A reduction in
   the rate of flows between client and VPN/proxy might allow the
   attacker to link the altered flow to the client.

   +--------+
   | Client |------.
   +--------+       \      +-------+
                     '---->|       |            +--------+
   +--------+              |  VPN  |<==========>|        |
   | Client |------------->|   /   |<==========>| Server |
   +--------+              | Proxy |<==========>|        |
                     .---->|       |     ^      +--------+
   +--------+       /      +-------+     |
   | Client |======'                     |
   +--------+      ^           Apply rate limit signal
                    \
                     \
                  Observe change

   An attacker that can manipulate TRONE headers can also simulate
   congestion signals by dropping packets or by setting the ECN CE bit.
   That will also likely result in changes in the congestion response by
   the affected client.

   A VPN or proxy could defend against this style of attack by removing
   TRONE (and ECN) signals.  There are few reasons to provide per-flow
   rate limit signals in that situation.  Endpoints might also either
   disable this feature or ignore any signals when they are aware of the
   use of a VPN or proxy.
